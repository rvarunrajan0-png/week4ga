# IRIS MLOps Pipeline with DVC and Google Cloud

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to manage Machine Learning datasets and models using DVC (Data Version Control) integrated with Git and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). It reproduces a simple end-to-end MLOps workflow built around the Iris dataset.

## Steps Implemented
1. Setup Git and DVC
2. Data Versioning using DVC
3. Model Training with scikit-learn
4. Reproducibility demonstration using git + dvc checkout

## Key Learnings
- DVC + Git = reproducible ML pipeline
- Cloud storage can serve as versioned data/model backend
- Switching between data and model versions is seamless
